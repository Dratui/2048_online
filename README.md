# AI_Arena

The goal of this project is to create a python library which allows its users to create games easily and make AIs compete in tournaments to decide which one is the best.

By default, the library comes with three games implemented  : 
  * 2048
  * Connect 4
  * TicTacToe

The rules to implement a new game are listed both in the wiki and in the how_to_create_a_game.md file.

The rules to create a new AI are listed both in the wiki and in the how_to_create_an_AI.md file.
