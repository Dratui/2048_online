LOTRO Character Naming Policy

Character names in The Lord of the Rings Online should try to reflect the adventurous and heroic spirit of The Lord of the Rings. When selecting a character name, please be aware of the type of character you are creating, be it a Human, Elf, Dwarf, or Hobbit. Each race has its own naming conventions and it is encouraged that you select a name befitting the race and spirit of your character. Although this is not required, it does helps to shape a fun, engaging, and immersive world for everyone.

The following are examples of character names and guild names that are NOT appropriate for The Lord of the Rings Online and is also applied to kinship and organization names. Some names that do not fall within one of the examples below may still be inappropriate. The Lord of the Rings Online Support has final say over what constitutes a violation of the character naming policy.

Proper names and places or close facsimiles thereof, from the story characters or non-player characters (NPCs) introduced in the fiction of Lord of the Rings Online.

    Sexually explicit, defamatory, obscene, racially or ethnically offensive names.
    Names of historical or religious significance.
    Trademarked names of products, goods, materials or services.
    Common names, slang or references to drug related substances, culture or paraphernalia.
    Names causing harm, mockery or imitation of Lord of the Rings Online players or NPCs, in addition to Standing Stone Games, Inc. employees, past or present.
    Misspelled variations or homonyms of any of the above rules.

 

Policy Enforcement

There is a Zero Tolerance rule in effect for the following name violations:

    Sexually explicit, defamatory, obscene, racially or ethnically offensive names.
    Common names, slang or references to drug related substances, culture or paraphernalia.
    Names causing harm, mockery or imitation of Lord of the Rings Online players or NPCs, in addition to Standing Stone Games, Inc. employees, past or present.

 

This means that if your character or kinship name is in violation, the name will be changed without question. For characters that violate this rule, your character name will be changed and your account will be automatically placed on a one day suspension for a first offense. For kinships that are in violation, the kinship name will be changed and the account of the kinship leader will be placed on a one day suspension for a first offense. Additional offenses will consist of further account actions, including possible closure.

For other naming violations, a Lord of the Rings Online Game Master will contact you in-game to discuss your character's name.
