<b>To make an AI file: </b>
- Create a python file in the AI folder
- Import the needed classes for the AI, for example:
* <i> from src.games.games import Game </i>  
* <i> from src.board import Board </i> 
to get more info on the attributes and functions, go and check the appropriate python files. 
- The only function you need to put in the file is a <b> ia_output(board,game)</b> function that return the move (which is and integer) that corresponds to the game and board given.
