If you have decided to contribute to humble project, welcome aboard !
-Please read the Code of Conduct if you are to interact a lot with any other developer on the project.
-With the project already having some games implemented, you should take a look at our conventions regarding our management of 
our classes and attributes to make yourself more familiar with how things are to be handled for compatibility.
-This project tries to be compatible with a number of potential game implementations, the problem with this is that a lot of
code can easily become obscure or not used for a game in particular but still present for compatibility concerns. Thus with
your code being potentially obscure, please make sure to comment all your code. Do not hesitate to add a readme file to define
all your conventions regarding a certain part of your code. Also tests are of course welcomed with arms wide open.
-Please make commits and PR with comments so that we may know what they contain.
-Feel free to implement your own game or AI, after all, the project aims to encompass a lot of things !
